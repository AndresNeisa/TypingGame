# Typing Game

Enjoy a didactic game built in which you need to translate as many words as posible :book:. This project was made as part of a hackathon with [Mintbean](https://mintbean.io/).

The goal of the game is to translate and type as many words in 30 seconds :hourglass:. Select a language, and click start to play. A random word will be displayed in the selected language, type the word in english to get a new word, or skip it pressing enter.
